# InterfaceArduino 
Raspberry; Serial COM, UART, Phyton; Arduino Controlling Arduino IO from Raspberry or any other Uart enabled platform (I.e.laptop with USB).



This code implements a simplified protocol to allow managing Arduino Uno R3 I/O from whatever platform capable to manage
UART data flow, including Raspberry PI or your laptop.

Arduino I/O is controlld by means of a set of commands sent to Arduino through its UART interface.

I2C (TWI) and SPI are not (yet) supported.
